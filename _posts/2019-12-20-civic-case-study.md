## Overview
The [Civic Software Foundation](https://civicsoftwarefoundation.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing data science, modern tech, and civic willpower together to create a force for public good. In fall of 2018 they launched the CIVIC Platform to enable the rapid development of web and mobile applications that leverage public data. However, feedback from CIVIC’s initial launch indicated that users didn’t understand what it was or what it did.

I collaborated on a cross-functional team of designers and executives to research and redesign CIVIC's new landing page.

## Goal
Build a new landing page that helps users understand what CIVIC is and how to get involved. Launch the site in time for the Civic Software Foundation’s Demo Day.

## Role
- Research
- Information Architecture
- Wireframing
- UX & UI Design

## Outcome
[civicplatform.org](https://civicplatform.org) was launched in front of an audience of over 500 local and national government officials, community organizations, and members of the tech community. The new and improved site included navigation, less jargon, and more information about how different contributors can get involved. Making the landing page more accessible to multiple audiences was an important step towards helping the Civic Software Foundation achieve their ultimate goal of connecting communities with public data and inspiring them to learn more about civic issues.
