I recently had the pleasure of speaking at [DonutJS](http://donutjs.club/) about my thoughts on self-optimization, self-improvement, and the tools and technology we use to measure our bodies and activities. This is a topic that has been heavy on my mind for the last few months as I've talked with others, struggled with my own health, and spent countless hours feeling confused and inadequate for being unable to use these tools to solve my problems.

After months of thinking about this the biggest thing I've learned is that so much of our shame, anxiety, and pain could be relieved if we relinquished the idea that we're not doing "enough" -- whether it's not eating "healthy" or exercising enough, not working hard enough, not studying or reading enough, or not seeing our friends and family enough. I've found this type of thinking to be especially common in the tech industry where the pressure to keep up and remain relevant is accelerated by rapidly changing technology.

However the truth, I've found, is that most of us are already doing the best we can.

Here's a video of the talk. It looks into the ways that culture and politics influence the need for self-improvement and argues for a gentler, more compassionate approach — one defined by our own values, not someone else’s.
