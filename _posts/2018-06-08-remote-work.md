This was a talk based on my [earlier research](https://medium.com/@elnoelle/what-colocated-teams-can-learn-from-remote-teams-f48bb4a708d1) on what makes remote work _work_. 

In today’s distributed world it is increasingly important to embrace some form of a distributed workplace. Whether teams sit in the same room or in separate home offices around the world, there are certain practices you can follow that not only make your team more remote-friendly, but more inclusive, diverse and resilient. The talk took a look at the practices of thriving remote teams — specifically their adoption of a written culture — and highlighted that their best practices are beneficial to all teams, distributed or otherwise.
