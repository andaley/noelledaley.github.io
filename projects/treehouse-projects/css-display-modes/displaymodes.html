			<p>I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>
			<p>In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. We have a saboteur aboard. Talk about going nowhere fast.</p>
