Hello! I'm Noelle, a software engineer residing in Portland, OR, where I spend my days writing React, JavaScript, and Ruby at [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com/). I'm excited about thoughtful UX/UI design and get a thrill from the challenge of turning chaos into beautiful organization. I enjoy crafting well structured code and tinkering away with tests. I'm dedicated to building a more empathetic, human-centered tech industry, which I occasionally [speak](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1763), [write](/blog/), and [rant](http://devhell.info/post/2016-07-11/unlikely-hero-fails-to-press-mute/) (good-naturedly) about. In my free time I'm an avid cyclist, wannabe foodie, occasional musician, and [curious traveler](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1muxaKlQ9ndnV7dptPwHesS8o89w&usp=sharing).
