Hello! I'm Adrianne (they/them), a frontend software engineer residing in Portland, OR, where I spend my days riding bikes and leading a UI team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/). I specialize in crafting thoughtful, user-friendly interfaces and turning complexity into beautifully organized, tested, and maintainable code.

My varied journey through tech over the last decade has shaped my approach to building great software. As a staff frontend engineer I currently focus on building a performant, reliable UI while navigating intersecting business, product and design needs and helping my teammates grow. My earlier background in community management and sociology equipped me with systems thinking and a passion for understanding human behavior. All of these experiences led me to an appreciation for UX and a knack for collaborating across multiple disciplines.

I'm dedicated to building a more empathetic, human-centered tech industry, which I occasionally [speak](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1763) and [write](/blog/) about. In my free time you'll find me organizing community bike rides, delving into my latest nonfiction curiosity, or scheming up my next big [travel adventure](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1muxaKlQ9ndnV7dptPwHesS8o89w&usp=sharing).
