Hello! I'm Adrianne (they/them), a software engineer residing in Portland, OR, where I spend my days riding bikes and leading a platform UI and design systems team at [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/). I specialize in crafting thoughtful systems and turning complexity into beautifully organized, tested, and maintainable code.

My varied journey through tech over the last decade has shaped my approach to building great software. As a staff engineer I currently focus on delivering a robust, accessible design system and infrastructure for Honeycomb's frontend engineers. At [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) I led the Vault UI team and helped launch [HCP Vault Dedicated](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault/hcp-vault-dedicated).  My earlier background in community management and sociology equipped me with systems thinking and a passion for understanding human behavior. All of these experiences led me to an appreciation for UX and a knack for collaborating across multiple disciplines.

I'm dedicated to building a more empathetic, human-centered tech industry, which I occasionally [speak](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1763) and [write](/blog/) about. In my free time you'll find me organizing community bike rides, delving into my latest nonfiction curiosity, or scheming up my next big [travel adventure](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1muxaKlQ9ndnV7dptPwHesS8o89w&usp=sharing).
